                    "text": "I'm -- I'm trying to hope.\nThese are appeals from a judgment of a three-judge District Court in New York, convened under the Urgent Deficiencies Act.\nThe questions involved concerned the Interstate Commerce Act and some questions under the Investment Company Act.\nThe judgment, which appears at page 555, has had a very sweeping impact on I.C.C.regulation and on the company and on its stockholders.\nIt did three major things.\nFirst, it enjoined part of a Commission order which continued jurisdiction over Alleghany, which is the company that controls New York Central, in connection with an application made in 1954 and decided by the Commission in 1955 by Alleghany with Central and others, continuing its control over Alleghany as a non-carrier controlling carriers.\nThe effect of that portion of the judgment is to oust -- oust Interstate Commerce Commission jurisdiction, not only over Alleghany but over other companies which may be carrier holding companies.\nThis jurisdiction over Alleghany had been exercised by the Commission continuously since 1945 and of course such a result has a far-reaching effect.\nNext, it set aside and enjoined an order of the Commission under Section 20 (a) of the Interstate Commerce Act, approving after a very careful consideration, a proposed issue by Alleghany of six percent preferred stock to some 130,000 preferred stockholders, preferred stock which was intended to wipeout about $18 million in accumulated dividends.\nSo the dividends might have ultimately be paid on the common stock.\nThis was in the teeth of a decision by the Interstate Commerce Commission with -- after hearing the appellees, upholding the issue against all the contention made against it as a proper security issue to be issued by a carrier holding company.\nAnd I think Your Honors will see as you scrutinize this record that the I.C.C.had given the most careful consideration to that question.\nAnd finally, going beyond any injunction against orders of the Interstate Commerce Commission, it undertook also to issue in the most comprehensive terms an injunction against the effectuation of the exchange of the preferred stock which have been approved by the Commission and which was in process at the time its injunction issued with the effect that all of this stock has been substantially frozen to the great hardship of the stockholders.\nWhen the Court issued a temporary injunction followed by its interlocutory injunction, some 900,000 of the new shares that already issued, some 400,000 remained to issue.\nAnd ultimately an application was made to Mr. Justice Harlan to stay the injunction, and he stayed it as to 900,000 shares already issued, but did not stay it as to the balance because that might have well, mooted this appeal.\nBut unfortunately, that stay was ineffective, substantially ineffective because the stock exchange in the light of the temporary injunction and in the light of the lawsuit had already substantially blocked trading in the securities.\nSo that in effect, since this injunction -- this stock has been completely frozen and the stockholders of the company have been un -- able to enjoy their stock interest.\nNow, its perfectly apparent, I submit, from the -- from the order on temporary injunction, from the opinion below, from the nature of the appellees' suit, that the Court thought it was called upon to determine whether regulation by the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Investment Company Act might be preferable to a regulation under the Interstate Commerce Act, and that this injunction was in substance a choice by the Court for a regulation under the Investment Company Act.\nAnd that was what the plaintiffs sought, they made it perfectly clear, explicitly clear that the whole basis of this suit was to enforce the Investment Company Act, and that runs right through the opinions below.\nNow, that choice was in the face, not only of outstanding orders of the Interstate Commerce Commission and of the S.E.C., recognizing that the Interstate Commerce Commission had jurisdiction here but also in face of the clear congressional choice represented by an explicit exemption in the Investment Company Act, that companies subject to regulation under the Interstate Commerce Commission Act were not within the Investment Company Act.\nA recognition which also obviously carried with it a recognition of the desirability of having the Interstate Commerce Commission regulates both carriers and the companies holding carriers which fall within the statute.\nThe -- as -- as Your Honor scrutinize the opinion below, I think it's perfectly apparent that the changing basis upon which the Court justified its action all really relate to a kind of a preference for regulation under the Investment Company Act.\nNow, the Urgent Deficiencies Act, as I shall argue at greater length later, certainly does not contemplate the exercise of general equity jurisdiction by the special three-judge court, so as to permit the Court to range widely as a one-judge Court might do.\nAnd when the Court went so far as to try to use this occasion to enforce another statute and to impose restrictions on the stockholders in order to accomplish that, it certainly exceeded any power confided to it under the Urgent Deficiencies Act.",

the stock order.\nMy warning signal is gone.\nI've got five minutes and I'm going to hurry if I may over the balance of this matter because I want to be sure to -- to pose the major problems to Your Honors.\nThe -- the directors of Allegheny decided in December 1954 that a -- an exchange of preferred stock ought to be worked out which would dispose of $18 million of accumulated back dividends on preferred which hold over any dividend granting on the common.\nThat proposal was submitted to stockholders in the early part of 1955.\nBefore it was submitted to stockholders, a proxy embodying a very full statement of the -- all considerations affecting the stock.\nIt proposed the exchange offer was put through the SEC in the regular way and all changes suggested by the SEC were adopted.\nThe proposal was put to the stockholders, 97.5% of the common stock represented at the meeting or 70% of all the common voted for it and a very substantial majority of the others.\nThe matter was fully presented to the Commission for approval.\nThe Commission approved it and issued an order of approval at the end of March and -- or at the end of May, and the -- under the terms of the offer.\nThe offer became effective and closed on June 6 and everybody who had submitted their stock for exchange prior to June 6 was entitled to get their stock after June 6, the new stock after June 6.\nAnd then, the appellees who had intervened before the Commission filed a motion for reargument and filed this suit.\nNow, I want to just make -- make a reference to the circumstances under which the temporary injunction was issued.\nBy filing their application for reargument before the Commission, they tied up the proceedings in the Commission.\nJune 6 was the last day when anybody could withdraw stocks submitted for exchange so that everybody was frozen in on June 6.\nThen, they filed this suit in the court below and this suit in its original form was a suit to enjoin the Bridge Company order, nothing about any stock order, nothing about the stock issue.\nThe only parties in the original action were the Commission and the United States.On June 16th, the plaintiffs made a motion for a temporary injunction.\nIt was returnable on June 23rd.\nAt their request, as I understand it, the -- the matter was adjourned to June 30th, but at least it wasn't at Allegheny's request.\nAllegheny wasn't a party and when Allegheny sought on June 21st to intervene, its proposed intervention was rejected by the other side.\nOn June 22nd, the Commission order approving the stock issue came down, came to Allegheny's attention on June 23rd.\nThey were obligated by their agreement with their stockholders to start exchanging stock immediately, and they did so.And the afternoon of that day, the temporary restraining order was issued.\nNow, here was a situation in which plaintiffs who'd been fully heard in the Commission who brought a suit not naming Allegheny, who did not in the suit has filled, ask any relief against the stockholder, whose temporary -- whose temporary injunction application didn't involve the stock.\nAnd directors and officers faced with a potential, very heavy liability to stockholders because if the market had gone down and they failed to make good on the exchange, they would have been liable.\nAnd so, they proceeded to start to make the exchange and the temporary injunction issued and ultimately a preliminary injunction issued.\nAs Your Honors will see, Judge Hincks dissented.\nHis view was that this was not a proper suit under the Urgent Deficiencies Act that the plaintiffs were trying to enforce the Investment Company Act which was not a proper purpose.\nHis opinion is cast in terms of absence of -- of irreparable damage, but that's obviously what he's talking about.\nI'm very sorry, but my -- I must keep my obligation about time.\nMay I say just one word more and then I'll sit down.\nWe submit that these orders of the Commission were valid and effective and that Allegheny has been subject to Commission jurisdiction and subject to the Commission's approval of this preferred stock and that the injunction should be reversed not on the -- the rather informal grounds suggested by the Solicitor General, but because it is -- it was a -- an injunction which the court below had no right to issue that it has ousted the Interstate Commence Commission of jurisdiction long enjoyed and -- and which Congress has imposed upon it and that this injunction has had the most disastrous effect upon the company and upon its stockholders.\nNow, every other question I must leave on the briefs is a grave question about the standing of these plaintiffs to maintain this action, a very grave question about the -- I think there's no real question about the jurisdiction of the I.C.C.\nThey raised some procedural questions.\nI think we've got them fully dealt on the briefs and I won't take anymore of your time.",

Marshall Transport, decided by this Court in 1944, a non-carrier already controlled a carrier and that carrier then acquired the properties of another carrier.\nThis Court held that that transaction simultaneously involved an acquisition of control by the non-carrier parent of the latter carrier of the acquired carrier and that the non-carrier parent must seek and obtain the Commission's approval of such an indirect acquisition of control.\nSince the Marshall Transport case in 1944, the Commission has held in several cases that a non-carrier parent must obtain approval under Section 5 (2) for the modification of its existing control of subsidiaries.\nAnd I'd like to get two examples of it.\nOne, a small case involving motor carriers, the Commission held that upon a merger of two carriers controlled by an individual, that that individual must join in the application and seek and obtain the Commission's approval for his modification -- for the -- the modification of his control over the two carriers.\nThen, in a larger case, in 1947, the Pere Marquette merger, the Commission authorized under section 5 (2) the merger of the properties of the Pere Marquette Railroad into Chesapeake in Ohio.\nNow, Chesapeake in Ohio already had stock control of Pere Marquette.\nAnd at the same time, the Commission found that Alleghany's acquisition of control through its existing control at Chesapeake in Ohio of the properties of Pere Marquette through that merger of Pere Marquette into Chesapeake in Ohio was a transaction which came within the scope of section 5 (2).\nNow, we submit then in -- in this case the Commission did substantially the same thing.\nIt held that section 5 (2) required its approval of the change or modification of Alleghany's control of the Bridge Company properties which resulted from the double transaction of the merger of the Bridge Company properties and the Big Four, and the simultaneous lease of the -- of the Bridge Company properties by Big Four to New York Central which was directly controlled by -- by Alleghany.\nAnd we think that that construction of section 5 is necessary to carry out the purposes of the Act.\nThat purpose shows not only in the broad sweep of section 5, but in a legislative history equally sweeping in purpose, a purpose to place the entire process of carrier consolidation and unification under public regulation.\nAnd as a practical matter, contrary to the view to the court below, this increases or modifications of control can involve a good deal more than intra-system bookkeeping and the Pere -- Pere Marquette merger is an example of that.\nAn increase in the stock control of a carrier may enable its direct or indirect non-carrier parents to bring about corporate actions which a lesser form of control would not permit.\nThe merger of a carrier previously controlled by a stock ownership signals the end of the possibility of independent operation of that carrier.\nAnd in the history of Alleghany, this is rather a dramatic illustration of that.\nSome years ago, Alleghany controlled C & O, Pere Marquette, and Nickel Plate.\nThrough the years, different factors, economic factors, Pere Marquette was merged in the C & O.\nNickel Plate on the other hand has become a completely independent carrier competing vigorously with C & O.\nAt the same time, such mergers, such -- such rearrangements of a system will often signal a change in -- in the management or in the policies of a holding company.\nSuch a change as would warrant the Commission for the first time in subjecting such a non-carrier parent to partial regulation as a carrier under section 5 (3), particularly with respect to security issues.",

                    "text": "Mr. Chief Justice, may it please this Court.\nThere are seven parties before the Court on these appeals.\nAlleghany Corporation controlled by Mr. Young and his Chairman and Mr. Kirby, its president.\nAdelaide Neuwirth, represented by Mr. Kahan who just spoke, who was a common stockholder but who does not appeal from the jurisdictional questions involved in the judgement below, who merely appeals from the injunctive provisions of the judgement and who took no active part in the proceedings below.\nAnd there is the one preferred stockholder represented by Mr. Levin, Gruss &Company, a New York Stock exchange firm.\nWe have the Interstate Commerce Commission who identifies with Alleghany in this case, except on the question of standing to sue and except as to the laws of Alleghany's carrier status on January 19, 1954, in which respects, it identifies with our position.\nWe have the Securities and Exchange Commission which has supported the appellees in this case on all investment company aspects of the case, as set forth in its brief amicus.\nAnd the United States who did not appeal from the judgement below, who instead has filed a brief here in which it has confessed error.\nMay I read briefly from the Government brief at page 18 in which it sets its position for?\nIn the District Court, the United States supported the I.C.C. in defending its orders.\nHowever, upon for the study of the issues and upon consideration of the Court's opinions, the United States has concluded that the District Court correctly held (1) That Alleghany did not acquire control under section 5 (2) of the Interstate Commerce Act of the Bridge Company through the merger of the latter with the Big Four.\nAnd that the I.C.C. therefore had urged in subjecting Alleghany to carrier status.\nAnd (2), that 1945 status order was terminated by this order in the merger proceedings.\nUnder this view, the I.C.C. orders authorizing the preferred stock issue were invalid for lack of jurisdiction.\nAnd then finally, we have the three common stockholders whom I represent and who for two long years and if I may be permitted to say so, quite along have raised the question of the nullity of the Interstate Commerce Commission's orders and the importance in the public interest of Alleghany registration and its subjection to the jurisdiction of the Securities and Exchange Commission, propositions now supported both by the United States and by the SEC.\nThey sue not only in their own right as stockholders, but in the right of the entire class.\nNow, this appeal is from a unanimous judgement of the three-judge Court, including the late Judge Frank, Judge Dimock and Judge Walsh.\nThe court below decided five substantive questions and every one of them was resolved in favor of the appellees.\nBut actually, a finding on anyone of them will dispose of this appeal and require affirmance of the judgement below.\nThe decision of the court below was synthesized in two or three sentences which I take the liberty of reading.\nQuoting, \u201cWe believe that the I.C.C. had no appropriate application before it for a determination of the question of the control.\nThe case cannot therefore be remanded for such a determination.\nThe I.C.C.'s orders purported to determine the question of control of Central, but that determination cannot stand, (A) because the findings as to Alleghany's control of Central are insufficient.\n(b) Because the evidence does not support this findings and (C) because plaintiffs were deprived of an evidentiary hearing on that issue of control.\nThere was one other substantive issue in the case, which has been the subject of colloquy between Court and counsel in the argument that proceeded.\nAnd that was whether the merger was authorized, of whether -- whether the merger authorized I.C.C.jurisdiction or provided the basis for it.\nAnd concerning that question, the Court said this.\nQuote, \"But where as the instant case the non-carrier Alleghany is according to our assumption arguendo already in indirect control of such property.\nNo acquisition by the non-carrier results from the merger.\u201d\nThis seems to us the plain, clear and obvious interpretation of the statute.\nNow, at the threshold we're presented with the reviewability and standing to sue questions.\nAll the I.C.C.o rders reviewable.\nDo we have standing to sue?\nThe I.C.C. doesn't challenge our standing to sue and the United State agrees that we have standing to sue.\nThe District Court held that the orders were reviewable.\nIt confirmed all right to challenge them.\nIt pointed out that the orders had caused us direct and substantial injury, that our stock was threatened with dilution and if anything more were needed to point up the adversity of our position from that of Alleghany's, we have it in the Securities and Exchange Commission, decision of November 30, 1956, when by virtue of its findings of unfairness to the common stockholders and I shall demonstrate that that is in the record and that my statement is correct.\nOur position was both adverse to Alleghany and adverse to the preferred stockholders specifically, on that very question.\nThe result of the I.C.C. order approving the preferred stock plan was to increase the dividend on the new -- new preferred stock from 5.5% to 6%.\nThat directly hurt the common stock.\nIn addition, the I.C.C. orders -- ordered the conversation ratio.\nThat is the number of shares which the -- which the new stock would command.\nThe number of common stock shares which the new stock would command if the conversation rights were exercised and increase them from 34 to 47.\nAnd then, of course, in addition to section 18 (d) as the SEC found, bars the use of this call on the common stock by the preferred stockholders as a matter of law.\nAlthough as we say it confirmed our right to sue, they were specific findings by the SEC.\nThey are implicit in the judgement of the court below.\nAccording to Alleghany's view we have no remedy in any court.\nThey say that they argued in opposition to a motion that we made before Judge Walsh sitting as a single judge in a derivative action which our clients had started against Alleghany, that we were not entitled to a temporary injunction in that one-judge court.\nAnd they succeeded in persuading Judge Walsh to deny the motion and Judge Walsh did so remitting us to our administrative remedies before the I.C.C.\nThe nub of this decision was that we haven't exhausted our remedies there.\nPursuant to the direction in his judgment we did go before the I.C.C.\nAnd these -- this judgment raises the orders of the Interstate Commerce Commission.\nNow, Your Honors, if we're wrong on every phase of this question of standing to sue we say that the judgment below stands as a judgment of a one-judge District Court.\nThat is, the three-judge District Court may be -- the judgment may be considered as a one-judge court and that the -- contrary to what Alleghany argues in its brief, it was not necessary for us to join the directors in this case in order to have a sufficient complaint in law before the three-judge court, because that question is not reviewable here.\nAnd secondly, its -- is -- the fact is that we sued individually and representatively and in neither situation were we required to join directors.\nIn other words, we had a right to seek an injunction against what we considered to be a -- a preferred stock plan that was inequitable and unfair to us and that was being promulgated pursuant to avoid I.C.C. order.",

status order or the jurisdiction assuming order.\nAnd the other, the order by which it approved the preferred stock plan.\nThe second followed the first.\nNow, as we see the issues here in this case with respect to injunction to which I'm going to address myself first because of Mr. Levin's approach to this question.\nWas the District Court powerless merely because it was an Urgent Deficiencies Act Court, to maintain the status quo -- quo by an appropriate injunction?\nWasn't obliged to stand by powerless while a -- a defiant party, disregarding the pending proceedings which could have been determined within a few days deliberately and I should try to demonstrate this deliberately disrupted the status quo in order to present the District Court with (Inaudible) common plea, which it considered would be beyond the power of the District Court to recall.\nNow, was the District Court -- was the District Court bound to consider equities inuring to the appellate, solely by virtue of the disruption of the status quo?\nThat question is also presented in its proper focus.\nNow, Your Honor, this is the chronology of events which preceded the disruption of the status quo.\nThis is what happened.\nOn June 2nd, 1955, the appellees filed a petition for reconsideration of Division 4's order approving the preferred stock plan.\nIt requested the full commission to stay in adverse order if it made one for a reasonable time so that we could go to the District Court and get an injunction.\nOn June 6th, 1955, we commenced this action.\nAnd a few days later, on June 15th, 1955, we moved for a preliminary injunction, returned it on June 23rd.\nWe didn't ask for any temporary restraining order, because we considered it inconceivable that Alleghany would be advised to issue its stock, while our motion for a preliminary injunction was sub iudice.\nOn June 21st, Alleghany's counsel moved for leave to intervene.\nAnd in their papers, they admit notice of our application for a temporary injunction, although the papers had not been served upon because they were not then in the case, the defendants being merely the United States and the Interstate Commerce Commission (Inaudible).\nOn this -- on the same day, contrary to what has been suggested here, the Government and the I.C.C. joined in an application to the District Court to adjoin the motion for a temporary injunctions until June 30th, but no one told the District Court that on the following day an order would come down from the Interstate Commerce Commission which would permit Alleghany, if it so desire, to issue the stock, because there was then no temporary restraining order.\nAnd on the following day within less than 20 hours after the application for the adjournment was made to the District Court, the order did come down.\nAnd that order reached the possession of the Alleghany's counsel on -- at -- in Washington on noon of June 23rd.\nAt 4:30 that afternoon, I was telephoned by Alleghany's counsel and told that the full commission had approved this preferred stock plan and that the issuance and distribution of the stock was actually under way.\nIn less than an hour, I prepared an application for a temporary restraining order.\nI submitted it to Judge Dimock and at 5:55 that evening, he signed it and it brought to a halt the further issuance and distribution of these securities, leaving 876,000 shares, distributed to the extent that they were in the hands of the original, old preferred stockholders and that is a crucially important distinction.\n468,000 were left undistributed and the persons entitled to those merely held receipts for their old securities, which -- but for the temporary restraining order, they could have presented and claimed their new securities.\nSo that the result of the temporary restraining order was to leave these securities frozen through, but frozen in the hands of the original holdings.\nAnd they never reached the stream of commerce and they never went to a single person who could truthfully say that he was without notice of the infirmities in the Commission's jurisdiction and I shall develop that point in just a moment.\nNow, in this manner, Your Honors, Alleghany deliberately disrupted the status quo.\nIt could have waited for six or seven days, until there was an argument on this motion for a temporary injunction on the merits.\nIt could have urged all its grounds for opposition at that time, but not -- notwithstanding, it elected despite the pendency of the motion to go forward and to create this (Inaudible) common plea from which we have these anguished cries of innocence made here in the argument.\nNow, when questioned by the District Court on the following day when a motion to vacate the temporary restraining order was made as to why the order couldn't be relaxed in such a way so as to give those new preferred stockholders an opportunity to exchange their securities and get back the ones that they had given up, which were valid securities and were being traded on the market and which they could turn into cash if they wanted to sell them, Alleghany counsel said, I quote him.\n\u201cBut the thing having gone forward, we cannot unscramble it.\u201d\nAnd counsel for Gruss & Company then later took a similar position.\nThere never was -- there never was a disassociation by the preferred stockholders from that position.\nNow, getting to the question of the innocence of these preferred stockholders, because that nub of the question insofar as the equities are concerned assuming that they are entitled to raise any questions of equity.\nThe preferred stockholders say they're innocent and Alleghany as Judge Dimock found attempts to hide behind them, because if the preferred stockholders present -- prevail the Alleghany position is rectified and they can get the benefit of any relief that is given to the preferred stockholders.\nThese preferred stockholders are

waiting nine months to clarify their status doing that volitionally and without making any -- and knowing that the -- they had divested themselves of control of CNO on January 19, 1954, and that they were in the Netherlands, so to speak, an unregistered investment company.\nThey waited for nine months to make their application and they finally filed it on September 20, 1954.\nNow, in that application, curiously enough, they'd invest for Interstate Commerce Commission approval of the control of the New York Central system.\nIn fact, they quite candidly say in their briefs and here, and said it then, that they don't have to make such an application.\nOn the other hand, what they did do is they claimed that they already had control of the New York Central system with its 73 companies, most of which are carriers.\nAnd they merely asked for the approval of the merger, of let us say the 73rd company with the 72nd, claiming that that excused the necessity for applying for approval of all 73.\nAnd we say that -- that our proposition is illogical and fallacious upon its phase and we say it was a wholly and consistent position for them to take and that is precisely what Division 4 for so held at record 426.\nSo strange was this merger application, so curiously worded was it that it evoked from Judge Dimock this observation, \u201cThe prayer for the approval of the merger is treated as if it were an effective but meaningless incantation to propitiate a medicine man.\u201d\nNow, Alleghany argues that it's subsequent if it didn't have control on May 26, 1954, its subsequent purchases of New York Central stock and it's acquisition of voting rights gave it a control which it did not previously had.\nThe first answer to the question is that the ICC findings weren't predicated on subsequent control -- subsequent acquisitions.\nIt -- they did mention 600,000 shares but they found that the control existed as of May 26, 1954 by virtue of a proxy contest, a concept which is statically impossible in the light of the stockholdings of the parties as I have given them to you.\nIt was Young and Kirby control of Alleghany, we say, that was crucial because the issue here is not how many shares of stock New York Central that Alleghany owned, the issue is who controls Alleghany's right to vote the shares which Alleghany owned or to exercise the voting rights which Alleghany acquired.\nAnd whether Young and Kirby control of these rights, plus their own Central holdings, gave them, as distinguished from Alleghany, control of New York Central, gave them in the language of the statute the power to exercise control.\nInterstate Commerce Commission dealt, not at all, with this aspect of the case.\nAlleghany has argued that under Section 15 (2) of the Act, the ICC orders must be continued and being continued in effect until they are terminated by a subsequent order and that the 1945 orders vesting control of the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad in Alleghany perpetuated Alleghany's control, and it's -- perpetuated its carrier's status through these entire proceedings.\nWell, we say that it was not possible, legally possible for this to happen.\nThe full Commission found that Alleghany was in fact a prison, not a carrier after January 19th, 1954.\nWe say that on that day, as a result of that finding, Alleghany became an -- an unregistered investment company.\nAs such, it could not acquire control of the New York Central system validly without violating Section 7 of the Investment Company Act, which prohibits an unregistered company from acquiring control of any company engaged in Interstate Commerce.\nAnd furthermore, we say that if the 1940 SCC registration was automatically revived by virtue of the loss of the Chesapeake and Ohio on January 19, 1954.\nThen in terms of the Investment Company Act, Alleghany violated Section 18 (d) of that statute by issuing a security which did not meet standards of that Section as found by the SCC a few months ago.\nNow, we say, if the District Court and the United States, and appellees are all wrong about this proposition, about the continuation of the orders and if, as Alleghany claims, that the 1945 order continued and effect throughout 1955 or is still in effect then we say that Alleghany violated the Interstate Commerce Act.\nBecause under the CNO order of 1945, they were granted control of the CNO and given carrier status under Section 5 (3), only under the stipulation which they voluntarily made and which is incorporated in the Commissions order that if they acquired any -- of the stock of any carriers, subsequently any carriers other than the CNO, they would have to put them in a voting trust so as to insulate them against Alleghany voting control.\nAnd we -- and we say also, it violated that provision of the -- of the 1945 order which debarred Alleghany from having an interlocking -- locking directorate with any railroad other than the Chesapeake and Ohio.\nAnd yet, the first thing that Young and Kirby did when they took control of the -- of Central in May 26, 1954, was to elect Young, the chairman of the board.\nNow, we say therefore, that this argument of continuation and control is sterile one.\nIt has no impact on this case because no matter how you view it, it's merely an attempt to create a defense to another case in another court and it has no bearing on the issues of this case.\nNow, Alleghany argues that it was never necessary for it to make any control application because when it controlled the 73 companies, it was only controlling one, 73 equals one is the demonstration that they make an effect.\nThe legislative history, which I won't have the time to go into here is set forth from pages 68 to 70 of -- of our brief, and at page 70 we show that as a result of the senate investigation of -- of Alleghany and other investment companies who are holding securities and carriers, the Congress determined to dispel any ambiguity and to close any loophole that might have existed with respect to this very question and by the enactment of the Transportation Act of 1940 and the text language which the Congress enacted at that time, if there wasn't an ambiguity, there wasn't a loophole, it was closed.\nThe text matter that set forth in our brief below, the quotation of the statute at page 70 illustrates our point in this regard.\nBut Division 4 had no doubt about this, Division 4 had no illusions on the subject of what control of 73 carriers means in terms of ICC standards.\nBut this is what it said in this case, \u201cWe have long recognized under Section 5 that railroad systems are comprised of two or more carriers and that control of a single system may not lawfully be effectuated without our approval and authorization.\"\nBecause that principle is considered basic, almost as a definition, so much so that the question of acquisition of a carrier system has never been contested before the Commission.\nAnd as far as we know, there have been no Court decisions touching on that issue.\nI know the full Commission repudiated that the finding of the Division 4, but we think the full Commission was wrong and Division 4 was right, and the District Court agreed with the construction that we placed upon it and that Division 4 placed upon at this aspect of the case.\nWe say that Alleghany itself acquiesced in this interpretation in 1945 when a proceeding to administer certain sanctions to Alleghany for a failure to have made a -- application for control of CNO reached the stage of a proposed examiner's report and -- in which examined the both that time upheld this very same construction of the statute that we're now claiming for and insisted that an application would have to be made.\nAs a matter of fact, it was in settlement of the -- of the potential sanctions that Alleghany was faced with in the 1945 proceeding that the CN order -- CNO order of 1945 finally emerged and the CNO order contains a direct finding that Alleghany had acquired control of the CNO.\nAt that time it had control of no other carrier and yet the Commission found it necessary to incorporate it in its order -- in its report in this finding.\nWe further find that acquisition by Alleghany Corporation of control through ownership of stock as above described of the Chesapeake and Ohio, Nickel Plate, Pere Marquette and their subsidiaries and affiliates is a transaction within the scope of Section 5 (2) of the Interstate Commerce Act.",

regulatory problems that may well be.\nI haven't examined it in that light, but I do say this to you sir, that the ICC's jurisdiction is not diminished in one wit because if these lessors did anything at change, they control the railroad, then they would be caught or the Central, the parent company would be caught by the carrier provisions for the first three clauses of Section 5 (2), not the non-carrier provisions of the fourth and fifth clauses.\nSo this is not diminishing in one wit the ICC's regulatory powers over these kind of companies.\nAll we're saying here is there was no basis in ICC -- in the ICC statute to find that was an acquisition of control of a carrier by any of these transactions.\nAnd in the Bridge Company, of course, Big Four is a lessor.\nAnd the only carrier who's control is legibly is acquired is this two and a half mile company called the Bridge Company out of some thousand miles of New York Central System.\nAnd that brings -- it gets one other point, Alleghany claims that it didn't have to make a control application for control of the 73 carriers.\nAlthough, the statute says in Clause 4 of Section 5 (2), that two or more carriers, whenever their control is acquired, must be authorized and must be approved.\nAnd it was Alleghany itself which -- whose activities in 1937 lead to the Senate Interstate Commerce Commission's investigation, which lasted from 1937 to 1940, 27 reports were issued by that committee of which half of them dealt with Alleghany and it was to close the very loophole in the statute which they alleged existed.\nThen Alleghany alleged -- Mr. Young and Mr. Kirby alleged existed so they -- didn't have to bring a scrutiny of Chesapeake and Ohio control to Alleghany to the Commission.\nIt was that very loophole which was singled out in Senate Report Number 180, mentioned in our brief and which it should be closed if it exists.\nWe don't think it exists under one interpretation, the courts may find it doesn't exist under a null kind of interpretation of the 1933 statute.\nBut if it does exist, it should be closed and we don't think that any fine spent arguments now when it's right, this should await further action by the Congress.\nIn 1940, Congress amended the statute and made, in its own words, clarifying changes, that's in the conference report.\nI don't want to detail the statutory changes that are on page 70 of our brief but they do say in effect, if you acquire control of two or more carriers through ownership of their stock then you have to come to -- to the Commission, that was the 1933 statute, through ownership of their stock, mind you, from -- in -- in that posture of the statute, New York Central was the only stock whose -- whose acquisition is of course being acquired by Alleghany.\nIt didn't go to the 72 other carriers because no ownership of the 72 carriers stock was being acquired.\nTherefore, the statute was amended to say, if you acquire control of two or more carriers through ownership of their stock, or otherwise, those two words we put in, or otherwise, therefore, when you acquire the control of New York Central Company, just one stock transaction, it didn't acquire control of the 72 through ownership of their stock, you acquire control of them or through the otherwise clause because Central had that stock.\nAnd the Senate Report said, this is an -- an ambiguity in the statute, they used that very word, there's an ambiguity here and the proof is ambiguity, Mr. 's Young and Kirby and the people before them were crossing around the control of a great railroad system as if it were a tie balloon, that's the words of the chairman.\nIt was chairman of the committee in 1937 and chairman in 1940 and that's why this -- this statute should be amended to prevent this kind of -- of transfer of control.\nI want to make one more reference to this point.\nMr. Ginnane refers to the difficulty of proxy contestants if this interpretation of the statute which we think is the law is adopted.\nHe says that everybody who acquires control in the proxy contest would have to come to -- to the Commission, that isn't so sir.\nBecause if nobody has acquired controlling blocks of stock as Young and Kirby did with their associates, their million shares, then of course, without any controlling blocks of stock for 10,000 stockholders have control, but they don't exercise it until that one day they come together for the meeting and they voted.\nAnd they merely had voted, the directors take office and the stock control is dissipated again among the 10,000 units or whatever the number of stockholders maybe.\nIf the only coalesces of each election, there is no acquisition of control within the statutory language.\nAnd it's only because of this that the -- this argument that Alleghany seeks to avoid scrutiny of the public interest finding that it has acquired control.\nThank you, Your Honor.",

Breswick & Co.Argued January 23-24, 1957Decided April 22, 1957*353 U.S. 151Syllabus\n\nIn a suit by appellees, who are minority common stockholders of Alleghany Corporation (an investment company), a three-judge District Court set aside orders of the Interstate Commerce Commission granting Alleghany the status of a noncarrier to be \"considered as a carrier\" under \u00a7\u00a7 5 (2) and 5 (3) of the Interstate Commerce Act and approving Alleghany's issuance of new preferred stock convertible into common stock.  It also enjoined Alleghany from issuing the new preferred stock.  The Commission's orders were based on its holding that Alleghany, being in control of the New York Central Railroad, needed Commission approval under \u00a7 5(2) to merge one subsidiary of the New York Central into another.\nHeld:\n1. As common stockholders whose equity might be \"diluted\" by the issuance of the new preferred stock, appellees had sufficient financial interest to give them standing to sue to set aside the Commission's orders.  Pp.  353 U. S. 159-160.\n2. Since the Commission's order conferring on Alleghany the status of a noncarrier to be \"considered as a carrier\" gave the Commission jurisdiction to approve the preferred stock issue, appellees could attack that order.  P.  353 U. S. 160.\n3. The Commission had jurisdiction over Alleghany under \u00a7\u00a7 5 (2) and 5(3).  Pp.  353 U. S. 160-172.\n(a) It is unnecessary to decide whether Commission approval of acquisition of control of a single integrated railroad system is required; if Alleghany in fact controlled Central, that was sufficient to meet the statutory requirement of \"a person which is not a carrier and which has control of one or more carriers.\"  Pp.  353 U. S. 161-162. Page 353 U. S. 152\n(b) The Commission's findings amply support its conclusion that \"control\" of Central was in Alleghany.  Pp.  353 U. S. 162-165.\n(c) The Commission was justified in finding that the merger of one of Central's subsidiaries into another involved an \"acquisition of control\" of a \"carrier\" by Central and Alleghany within the meaning of \u00a7 5(2).  Pp.  353 U. S. 165-171.\n(d) The failure to join two stockholders alleged to control Alleghany did not oust the Commission of jurisdiction.  Pp.  353 U. S. 171-172.\n4. Appellees were not entitled to a hearing in the proceedings in which the Commission approved the merger of two of Central's subsidiaries and granted Alleghany he status of a noncarrier to be \"considered as a carrier\" under \u00a7 5(2), since they were not \"interested parties\" within the meaning of \u00a7 5(2)(b).  Pp.  353 U. S. 172-175.\n(a) The fact that appellees were common stockholders of Alleghany is insufficient \"interest,\" since that proceeding had no special effect on appellees, and did not pose any individualized threat to their welfare.  P.  353 U. S. 174.\n(b) That assertion of jurisdiction by the Commission would deprive appellees of the benefits of the Investment Company Act of 1940 did not give them sufficient \"interest\" in that proceeding.  Pp.  353 U. S. 174-175.\n5. Appellees' claim that they were entitled to a hearing in the preferred stock proceeding is governed by \u00a7 20a(6), which provides that \"The Commission may hold hearings, if it sees fit, to enable it to determine its decision on application for authority.\"  P.  353 U. S. 175.\n6. The judgment of the District Court is reversed, and the case is remanded for consideration by the District Court of appellees' claim that the preferred stock issue, as approved by the Commission, was in violation of the Interstate Commerce Act.  P.  353 U. S. 175.\n138 F. Supp. 123 reversed and remanded. Page 353 U. S. 153\n\n",

Since the Commission's order conferring on Alleghany the status of a noncarrier to be \"considered as a carrier\" gave the Commission jurisdiction to approve the preferred stock issue, appellees could attack that order.  P.  353 U. S. 160.\n3. The Commission had jurisdiction over Alleghany under \u00a7\u00a7 5 (2) and 5(3).  Pp.  353 U. S. 160-172.\n(a) It is unnecessary to decide whether Commission approval of acquisition of control of a single integrated railroad system is required; if Alleghany in fact controlled Central, that was sufficient to meet the statutory requirement of \"a person which is not a carrier and which has control of one or more carriers.\"  Pp.  353 U. S. 161-162. Page 353 U. S. 152\n(b) The Commission's findings amply support its conclusion that \"control\" of Central was in Alleghany.  Pp.  353 U. S. 162-165.\n(c) The Commission was justified in finding that the merger of one of Central's subsidiaries into another involved an \"acquisition of control\" of a \"carrier\" by Central and Alleghany within the meaning of \u00a7 5(2).  Pp.  353 U. S. 165-171.\n(d) The failure to join two stockholders alleged to control Alleghany did not oust the Commission of jurisdiction.  Pp.  353 U. S. 171-172.\n4. Appellees were not entitled to a hearing in the proceedings in which the Commission approved the merger of two of Central's subsidiaries and granted Alleghany he status of a noncarrier to be \"considered as a carrier\" under \u00a7 5(2), since they were not \"interested parties\" within the meaning of \u00a7 5(2)(b).  Pp.  353 U. S. 172-175.\n(a) The fact that appellees were common stockholders of Alleghany is insufficient \"interest,\" since that proceeding had no special effect on appellees, and did not pose any individualized threat to their welfare.  P.  353 U. S. 174.\n(b) That assertion of jurisdiction by the Commission would deprive appellees of the benefits of the Investment Company Act of 1940 did not give them sufficient \"interest\" in that proceeding.  Pp.  353 U. S. 174-175.\n5. Appellees' claim that they were entitled to a hearing in the preferred stock proceeding is governed by \u00a7 20a(6), which provides that \"The Commission may hold hearings, if it sees fit, to enable it to determine its decision on application for authority.\"  P.  353 U. S. 175.\n6. The judgment of the District Court is reversed, and the case is remanded for consideration by the District Court of appellees' claim that the preferred stock issue, as approved by the Commission, was in violation of the Interstate Commerce Act.  P.  353 U. S. 175.\n138 F. Supp. 123 reversed and remanded. Page 353 U. S. 153\nMR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\nThese are direct appeals under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1253, from a final judgment of a three-judge District Court for the Southern District of New York setting aside orders of the Interstate Commerce Commission and restraining appellant Alleghany Corporation from issuing a new class of preferred stock that had been approved by the Commission.  The case raises numerous questions regarding the jurisdiction and powers of the Commission, especially under \u00a7 5 of the Interstate Commerce Act, for the understanding of which a rather detailed statement of the facts is necessary.\nSection 5(2)(a), in its pertinent portions, provides:\n\"It shall be lawful with the approval and authorization Page 353 U. S. 154 of the Commission . . . (i) . . . for a person which is not a carrier to acquire control of two or more carriers through ownership of their stock or otherwise; or for a person which is not a carrier and which has control of one or more carriers to acquire control of another carrier through ownership of its stock or otherwise. . . .\"\n54 Stat. 899, 905. 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 5(2)(a). [Footnote 1]\nAppellant Alleghany Corporation is a Maryland corporation whose charter provides for extensive powers of investment under no express limitation.  After the passage of the Investment Company Act of 1940, 54 Stat. 789, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 80a-1 et seq., Alleghany registered as an investment company with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  In 1944, in connection with an application by the Chesapeake & Ohio Railroad for approval by the Interstate Commerce Commission of acquisition of the property of the Norfolk Terminal & Transportation Company, Page 353 U. S. 155 Alleghany, alleging that it controlled the Chesapeake & Ohio, filed a supplementary application with the Commission joining the Chesapeake & Ohio's application and seeking approval of its own acquisition of control of the Terminal Company through the action of the Chesapeake & Ohio.  In 1945, the Commission approved \"acquisition of control\" of the Terminal Company by the Chesapeake & Ohio and Alleghany as a transaction within \u00a7 5(2) and further found that Alleghany \"shall be considered as a carrier subject to the [reporting and securities] provisions of section 20(1) to (10) and section 20a(2) to (11) of the act.\"\n261 I.C.C. 239, 262.\nShortly thereafter, under the provisions of \u00a7 3(c)(9) of the Investment Company Act, [Footnote 2] the Securities and Exchange Commission held that Alleghany was no longer an investment company within the meaning of the Investment Company Act.  20 S.E.C. 731.\nIn March, April, and May, 1954, several petitions and complaints were filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission by the New York Central Railroad, a stockholder, a protective committee, and bondholder creditors of the Central, asserting violations of the law in Alleghany's purchases of New York Central stock.  In view of statements by Alleghany and Chesapeake & Ohio officials that Alleghany had disposed of its holdings of Chesapeake stock, that Commission, in June, ordered Alleghany to show cause why the 1945 order providing that Alleghany Page 353 U. S. 156 should be \"considered as a carrier\" should not be set aside.  Allegheny replied that it would accept an order terminating its control of the Chesapeake & Ohio, but requested delay until it could file a new application which, it alleged, would require the Commission's approval and continuance of its status as a noncarrier to be \"considered as a carrier\" under the Interstate Commerce Act.\nThe present proceedings were commenced by the filing of such an application by Alleghany and Central -- after the ousting of the old Central management in May in a proxy fight.  The contents of the application were described fully in the Report of Division 4 of the Commission:\n\"The Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railway Company [the Big Four], the Louisville & Jeffersonville Bridge and Railroad Company [the Bridge Company or the Jeffersonville], The New York Central Railroad Company, and the Alleghany Corporation . . . on September 20, 1954, jointly applied under section 5(2) of the Interstate Commerce Act . . . for approval and authorization of (1)(a) merger of the properties and franchises of the Jeffersonville into the Big Four for ownership management, and operation; and (b) modification of the lease of January 2, 1930, under which Central, as lessee, operates the property of Big Four, lessor, to give effect to the acquisition of additional property pursuant to the proposed merger of Jeffersonville into Big Four; (2) acquisition by Central and Alleghany, by virtue of their control of Big Four, of control of the properties of Jeffersonville; and (3) continuation of Alleghany's status as a carrier subject to the provisions of section 20(1) to (10), inclusive, and 20a(2) to (11), inclusive, of the act, as provided by section 5(3) thereof.\"\n290 I.C.C. 725-726.  Page 353 U. S. 157 The Big Four already owned all the capital stock of the Jeffersonville.  The Big Four itself had ceased to be an operating carrier in 1930; since then, the New York Central has operated it as lessee.  In addition, the New York Central owns 98.98% of the common, and 86.45% of the preferred, stock of the Big Four.\nOn March 2, 1955, Division 4 of the Commission approved and authorized the merger of the Jeffersonville into the Big Four; approved continued control of the properties and franchises of the Jeffersonville by the Central and Alleghany; modified the lease between the Big Four and the Central; continued Alleghany as a noncarrier to be \"considered as a carrier\" subject to the reporting and securities provisions of the Act; and terminated the effective portions of the 1945 order in the Chesapeake & Ohio proceeding.  290 I.C.C. 725.\nOn reconsideration, the whole Commission on May 24, 1955, affirmed the conclusions of Division 4.  It held that Alleghany had acquired control over Central; that at the time the present application was filed, Alleghany was in fact \"a person not a carrier which controlled an established system\"; that the acquisition of control over the Central was not within \u00a7 5(2)'s requirement of Commission approval; that the rearrangement by Central of its ownership or control of its subsidiaries was within \u00a7 5(2)'s requirement of approval by the Commission and that Alleghany as the controlling party was a necessary party; and that the terms and conditions of the transactions were fair and reasonable.  Rejecting the suggestion of the Securities and Exchange Commission, which had intervened, the whole Commission also held that it had no discretion to yield jurisdiction over Alleghany to the former agency. [Footnote 3]  295 I.C.C. 11. Page 353 U. S. 158\nSubsequent to their application with respect to the Jeffersonville, Alleghany, and Central, on December 17, 1954, filed an application under \u00a7 5(2) to \"acquire control\" of the Boston & Albany Railroad Company, the Pittsfield and North Adams Railroad Corporation, and the Ware River Railroad Company through purchase by Central of their capital stock.  The Central owned a little more than 16% of the Pittsfield's capital stock, and none of the capital stock of the other two railroads.  It operated the properties of the Boston & Albany, the Pittsfield, and the Ware River under leases due to expire in 1999, 1975, and 2873 respectively.  On March 22, 1955, less than three weeks after it had approved the application in the Jeffersonville proceeding, Division 4 of the Commission approved the acquisition of such control by Alleghany and Central.  (Opinion not reported.)\nA third application filed by Alleghany, on February 18, 1955, sought permission from the Commission to issue a new 6% convertible preferred stock pursuant to a charter amendment, approved by all classes of Alleghany's stockholders, that permitted consummation of Alleghany's proposed plan of allowing its outstanding cumulative 5 1/2% preferred stock to be exchanged for the new stock.  On May 26, 1955, two days after the whole Commission affirmed Division 4's orders in the Jeffersonville proceeding, Division 4 approved the new stock issue (conditioning its approval on modification of one term), and, on June 22, the full Commission denied reconsideration.\nAn action was then brought before a three-judge District Court by minority common stockholders of Alleghany to require the Commission to set aside its order granting Alleghany the status of a noncarrier to be \"considered Page 353 U. S. 159 as a carrier\" and its subsequent order approving the new class of preferred stock and to restrain Alleghany from issuing the new preferred stock.  The three- judge District Court, convened under the Urgent Deficiencies Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1336, 1337, 2321-2325, granted first a preliminary injunction, Breswick & Co. v. United States,\u00a0134 F. Supp. 132 (Circuit Judge Hincks, dissenting), and then a permanent injunction setting aside the Commission's order designating Alleghany as a \"carrier\" and also its order approving Alleghany's new class of preferred stock, restraining its issue.  138 F. Supp. 123. [Footnote 4]\nAlleghany moved for a new trial based on the \"acquisition of control\" involved in the Boston & Albany proceeding.  The District Court held that the Commission's order in that proceeding gave no validity of the orders in the Jeffersonville proceeding because of the Commission's failure to provide specifically in its Boston & Albany order that Alleghany should be \"considered as a carrier.\"  138 F. Supp. 138.  On appeal here from the final judgment below, we noted probable jurisdiction.  351 U.S. 903; I.C.C. v. Breswick & Co., 352 U.S. 816.\nAlleghany urges initially that the Commission's orders dealing with its status under the Interstate Commerce Act and dealing with its new preferred stock were not reviewable at the suit of appellees, that appellees had no standing.  We find that appellees do have standing to challenge these orders . This is not a case where \"the order under attack does not deal with the interests of Page 353 U. S. 160 investors,\" or where the \"injury feared is the indirect harm which may result to every stockholder from harm to the corporation.\"  Pittsburgh & W. Va. R. Co. v. United States, 281 U. S. 479,  281 U. S. 487.  The appellees are common stockholders of Alleghany.  The new preferred stock issue approved by the Commission is convertible, and, under relevant notions of standing, the threatened \"dilution\" of the equity of the common stockholders provided sufficient financial interest to give them standing.  See American Power & Light Co. v. SEC, 325 U. S. 385,  325 U. S. 388-389.\nHaving acquired standing to institute proceedings in the District Court by virtue of the threatened financial injury, appellees could also attack the order of the Commission conferring on Alleghany the status of a person not a carrier but to be \"considered as a carrier.\"  The status order was a source of the threatened financial injury.  If the Commission acted out of bounds in decreeing its status order, it had no power to approve the new preferred stock issue, and the plaintiffs would be entitled to relief. [Footnote 5]\nThis brings us to the substantive issues in the litigation.  In the main, these involve the jurisdiction of the Commission Page 353 U. S. 161 under \u00a7\u00a7 5(2) and 5(3) of the Act, defining its powers. [Footnote 6]  The validity of the status order under \u00a7 5(3) turns on compliance with the statutory requirement of \u00a7 5(2) of the Commission approval\n\"for a person which is not a carrier and which has control of one or more carriers to acquire control of another carrier through ownership of its stock or otherwise. . . .\"\nAppellants Alleghany and the Commission contend that the Jeffersonville and the Boston & Albany transactions both support the Commission's assertion of jurisdiction.  The District Court disagreed with respect to the former and, as we have seen, p.  353 U. S. 159, supra, found it unnecessary to pass on the latter.\nWhether the Jeffersonville transaction met the statutory requirement of \u00a7 5(2) raises three questions.  (1) Was Commission approval of Alleghany's acquisition of control over Central required?  (2) Did Alleghany in fact control Central?  (3) Did the Jeffersonville transaction involved an acquisition of control by Alleghany over the properties of the Jeffersonville?\nThe District Court held that whatever control Alleghany had over Central did not fit within the statutory requirement of \"a person which is not a carrier and which has control of one or more carriers\" because the Commission had not given the approval necessary for acquisition of control of Central and its subsidiaries, \"two or more carriers.\"\nThe Commission and Alleghany contend that Commission approval of the acquisition of a single, integrated system is not necessary.  We need not decide this question, however, and intimate no opinion on it, for, even if such approval in necessary, the statutory requirement of \"a person which is not a carrier and which has control of one or more carriers\" refers to \"control,\" and not Page 353 U. S. 162 to \"approved control.\"  There seems to be no reason to read in the word \"approved.\"  Such a holding would mean that the failure of a company engaging in a transaction requiring Commission approval to apply for that approval would deprive the Commission of jurisdiction.  Remedies against a violator are provided by \u00a7 5(7), (8), and (9) of the Act.  To punish a violator by depriving the Commission of jurisdiction over it would be indeed quixotic.  As the Commission points out, the problem would appear clearer were Alleghany contesting, rather than acquiescing in, its jurisdiction.\nControl in fact, then, is sufficient to satisfy the requirement of \u00a7 5(2).  Division 4 of the Commission reported the following:\n\"The capital stock of Central is widely held by the public, but control of its functions reposes in Alleghany and its officers as a result of a proxy contest preceding a stockholders' meeting of May 26, 1954, at which the nominees chosen by Alleghany were elected as Central's board of directors.  Alleghany has an undivided half interest in 600,000 shares of Central stock with voting rights to the 600,000 shares under joint venture agreements, and, in addition, owns 15,500 shares.  The voting rights of Alleghany represent almost 10 percent of the total shares of Central stock outstanding.  The chairman of the board of directors of Alleghany, who holds the same position with Central, beneficially owns 100,200 shares of the latter's stock.  The president of Alleghany is a director of Central, and beneficially owns 300,100 shares of the latter's stock.  A vice president of Alleghany holds a similar position with Central.\"\n290 I.C.C. at 727.\nDivision 4 recognized that \"the present control of the Central system has passed to Alleghany by regular corporate procedures. . . .\"  Id. at 741. Page 353 U. S. 163\nThe full Commission reached this conclusion:\n\"The contention that Alleghany does not control the individual directors on Central's board ignores the realities of the situation.  Alleghany and its allied interests have succeeded in electing sufficient members of the board to permit them to organize and elect their own officers.  Clearly, the tenure in office of such directors who permitted this action depends upon their conformance to the views of the stockholders who elected them.  In our opinion, the power thus reposing in Alleghany constitutes control of Central.\"\n295 I.C.C. 11, 16.  The District Court, however, held that,\n\"if the Commission's opinions contain a conclusion that Alleghany is in control of New York Central, those opinions lack sufficient findings to support that conclusion.\"\n134 F.Supp at 147.  It noted that the order of Division 4\n\"discloses the fact that Alleghany's beneficial holdings of the Central stock are less than the combined individual holdings of Kirby, Young, Richardson, and the Murchison group,\"\nand concluded that\n\"the findings do no more than say that Alleghany, with someone else, controls New York Central.  They do not even say whether the someone else, alone, has control.\"\nIbid.\nWe think that the District Court took too restricted a view of what constitutes \"control.\"  In 1939, in Rochester Telephone Corp. v. United States, 307 U. S. 125,  307 U. S. 145-146, arising under the Federal Communications Act, 48 Stat. 1064, 1065, 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 152(b), this Court rejected artificial tests for \"control\" and left its determination in a particular case as a practical concept to the agency charged with enforcement. [Footnote 7]  This was the broad scope Page 353 U. S. 164 designed for \"control\" as employed by Congress in the Transportation Act of 1940, 54 Stat. 899-900, 49 U.S.C. \u00a71(3)(b). [Footnote 8]  See United States v. Marshall Transport Co., 322 U. S. 31,  322 U. S. 38.\nThat Act also added \u00a7 1(3)(b) to the Interstate Commerce Act, providing:\n\"For the purposes of (section) 5 . . . of this Act, where reference is made to control (in referring to a relationship between any person or persons and another person or persons), such reference shall be construed to include actual as well as legal control, whether maintained or exercised through or by reason of the method of or circumstances surrounding organization or operation, through or by common directors, officers, or stockholders, a voting trust or trusts, a holding or investment company or companies, or through or by any other direct or indirect Page 353 U. S. 165 means, and to include the power to exercise control.\"\n54 Stat. 899-900, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1(3)(b).  Section 1(3)(a) provides:\n\"The term 'person' as used in this part includes an individual, firm, copartnership, corporation, company, association, or joint-stock association; and includes a trustee, receiver, assignee, or personal representative thereof.\"\n54 Stat. 899, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1(3)(a).  The Commission's findings, setting forth the events surrounding the proxy fight for control of Central, the common directors in both, the stockholdings of Alleghany's officers and stockholders in Central, and the sworn statement of Central in the Central-Alleghany application that Central is controlled by Alleghany amply support its conclusion that \"control\" of Central was in Alleghany.  See footnote 7 supra.\nThe question remains whether the second portion of the statutory requirement of Commission approval\n\"for a person which is not a carrier and which has control of one or more carriers to acquire control of another carrier through ownership of its stock or otherwise . . .\"\nhas been met.  What constitutes an acquisition of control?  The District Court gave this restricted interpretation:\n\"A merger of carriers may involve an acquisition of control by a noncarrier where, through the merger, the noncarrier acquires control (direct or indirect) of a carrier or carrier property which the noncarrier had previously not controlled; United States v. Marshall Transport Co., 322 U. S. 31. . . .  But where, as in the instant case, the noncarrier (Alleghany) is (according to our assumption, arguendo) already in indirect control of a carrier (Bridge Company), and the merger still leaves the noncarrier Page 353 U. S. 166 in indirect control of such property, no acquisition by the noncarrier results from the merger. . . .\"\n138 F. Supp.  at 127-128. [Footnote 9]  We think that this is too narrow a reading of the statute.  Not labels, but the nature of the changed relation, is crucial in determining whether a rearrangement within a railroad system constitutes an \"acquisition of control\" under \u00a7 5(2).\nThe Court has already considered twice what constitutes an \"acquisition of control\" under the Interstate Commerce Act.  In New York Central Securities Corp. v. United States, 287 U. S. 12, the Court interpreted \u00a7 5(2) as it read in the Transportation Act of 1920:\n\"Whenever the commission is of opinion . . . that the acquisition, to the extent indicated by the commission, by one of such carriers of the control of any other such carrier or carriers either under a lease or by the purchase of stock or in any other manner not involving the consolidation of such carriers into a single system for ownership and operation, will be in the public interest, the commission shall have authority by order to approve and authorize such acquisition, under such rules and regulations and for such consideration and on such terms and conditions as shall be found by the commission to be just and reasonable in the premises.\"\nIn that case, the order of the Commission permitting the New York Central Railroad to acquire control, by lease, Page 353 U. S. 167 of the railroad systems of the Big Four and the Michigan Central Railroad Companies, was under review.  Minority stockholders contended, inter alia, that the Commission could not authorize \"acquisition of control\" by lease, since the Central had already acquired control of both railroads by stock ownership.  The Court held that the\n\"disjunctive phrasing of the statute 'either under a lease or by the purchase of stock' must be read in the light of its obvious purpose, and cannot be taken to mean that one method must be exclusive of the other.\"\n287 U.S. at  287 U. S. 23.  Nowhere did it intimate that the lease was not an \"acquisition of control,\" even though the Central already had stock ownership control of both railroads.  In fact, the refusal to set aside the Commission's order necessarily involved approval of the Commission's finding of an \"acquisition of control,\" and the Court further stated:\n\"The public interest is served by economy and efficiency in operation.  If the expected advantages are inadequately secured by stock ownership, and would be better secured by lease, the statute affords no basis of the contention that the latter may not be authorized, although the former exists.  The fact that one precedes the other cannot be regarded as determinative if the desired coordination is not otherwise obtainable.\"\nIbid.\nThe Transportation Acts of 1933, 48 Stat. 211, and 1940, 54 Stat. 898, rewrote \u00a7 5 but retained the \"acquisition of control\" language, except that the phrase relating to method of acquisition -- \"under a lease or by the purpose of stock or in any other manner not involving the consolidation of such carriers into a single system\" -- became, for acquisitions by both carriers and noncarriers, an all-inclusive phrase in the 1940 Act -- \"through ownership of their stock of otherwise.\"  These changes do not lessen the authority of the New York Central Securities case in the scope to be given to an \"acquisition of control.\" Page 353 U. S. 168\nIn United States v. Marshall Transport Co., 322 U. S. 31, the Court interpreted \u00a7 5, as amended by the 1940 Act, 54 Stat. 899, 905, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 5.  The Court held that the noncarrier parent (Union) of a carrier (Refiners) that proposed to purchase the property and franchises of another carrier (Marshall) \"acquired control\" of the property and franchises of the vendor, and was therefore subject to the Commission's jurisdiction.  The substantive issues in that case were, of course, different from those of the present case, since there had been no prior relation between the noncarrier parent and the vendor carrier.  In reaching its decision, however, the Court was explicit regarding the purpose of \u00a7 5:\n\"It is not doubted that, if Union, having control of Refiners, sought to acquire stock control of Marshall, Union would be required by \u00a7 5(2)(b) to apply for the Commission's authority to do so.  But it is said that, having control of Refiners, Union may, by procuring Refiners' compliance with the purchase provisions of the statute alone, extend its control indefinitely to other carriers merely by directing the purchase of their property and business by Refiners, without subjecting itself to the jurisdiction of the Commission as provided in \u00a7 5(3), so long as Union does not act directly as the purchaser of the property or of a controlling stock interest in such other carriers.\"\n\"We think that neither the language nor the legislative history of the statute admits of so narrow a construction.  Section 5(4) makes it unlawful, without the approval of the Commission as provided by \u00a7 5(2)(a), for a person which is not a carrier and which has control of one or more carriers to acquire control of another carrier through ownership of its stock or otherwise.  Not only is this language broad Page 353 U. S. 169 enough in terms to embrace the acquisition of control by a noncarrier through the purchase, by a controlled carrier, of the property and business of another carrier, but the legislative history indicates that such was its purpose.\"\nId. at  322 U. S. 36-37.  See also id. at  322 U. S. 37-40.  In other words, a noncarrier may not gain \"control\" over carriers free of Commission regulation merely by operating through subsidiaries.\nThe crux of each inquiry to determine whether there has been an \"acquisition of control\" is the nature of the change in relations between the companies whose proposed transaction is before the Commission for approval.  Does the transaction accomplish a significant increase in the power of one over the other, for example, an increased voice in management or operation, or the ability to accomplish financial transactions or operational changes with greater legal ease?  This is the issue, and not the immediacy or remoteness of the parent from the proposed transaction, for, as we said in the Marshall Transport case, the parent can always, by operating through subsidiaries, make itself more remote.  In deciding this type of issue, of course, the finding of the Commission that a given transaction does or does not constitute a significant increase in the power of one company over another is not to be overruled so long as \"there is warrant in the record for the judgment of the expert body. . . .\"  Rochester Telephone Corp. v. United States, 307 U. S. 125,  307 U. S. 146.\nThe principal issue, therefore, in the Jeffersonville proceeding is not Alleghany's remoteness from, or closeness to, the proposed transaction, but rather the nature of the proposed transaction itself.  The Big Four, whose stock was largely owned by Central, owned all the stock of the Jeffersonville.  (By agreement between the Big Four and the Central, this stock was held by the Central.)  The proposal was to merge the Jeffersonville into the Big Page 353 U. S. 170 Four.  While the immediate practical effects of the merger on the operation of the Jeffersonville might be small, even minimal, a merger is the ultimate in one company's obtaining control over another.  So long as the Jeffersonville existed as a separate company, there was always the possibility that the Big Four, through the Central, might sell, or be forced to divest itself of, the Jeffersonville stock, and that the control of the Jeffersonville might thus pass to another railroad.  In considering this possibility, it is important to note that the Jeffersonville does not connect physically with the Big Four, but connects with it only by virtue of the Big Four's trackage rights over the Baltimore & Ohio, and that the Jeffersonville, with its few miles of track, also connects with the Pennsylvania, Baltimore & Ohio, Louisville & Nashville, Illinois Central, and Chesapeake & Ohio Railroads.\nThe merger of the Jeffersonville into the Big Four virtually precludes any change in the relation of the Jeffersonville lines to the Central system.  The Jeffersonville will be no more.  In view of this, it cannot reasonably be said that there has been no increase in the power of the Big Four, the Central, and, through its relation with them, Alleghany over the Jeffersonville.  While it is not always profitable to analogize \"fact\" to \"fiction,\" La Fontaine's fable of the crow, the cheese, and the fox demonstrates that there is a substantial difference between holding a piece of cheese in the beak and putting it in the stomach.\nDenial of power to the Commission to regulate the elimination of the Jeffersonville from the national transportation scene would be a disregard of the responsibility placed on it by Congress to oversee combinations and consolidations of carriers and\n\"to promote safe, adequate, economical, and efficient service and foster sound economic conditions in transportation and among the several carriers . . . ,\"\nand the further requirement that\n\"All of the provisions of this Act shall be administered Page 353 U. S. 171 and enforced with a view to carrying out the above declaration of policy.\"\nNational Transportation Policy, 54 Stat. 899, 49 U.S.C. preceding \u00a7 1.  We hold that the Commission was justified in finding that the merger of the Jeffersonville into the Big Four involved an \"acquisition of control\" of the Jeffersonville by Central and Alleghany within the meaning of \u00a7 5(2) of the Act.  Since the status order of the Commission is supportable by virtue of the Jeffersonville proceeding, we need not consider the District Court's denial of Alleghany's motion, based on the Boston & Albany proceeding, for a new trial.\nSeveral other matters urged by appellees remain to be considered.  Appellees contend that Alleghany did not acquire control of any carrier in the Jeffersonville proceeding, since the application was made by the Big Four as lessor and the Central as lessee, and that therefore the Big Four was a statutory lessor, and not a carrier, within \u00a7 5.  We need not discuss the distinction that appellees seek to assert between lessors and carriers, for the Jeffersonville, the railroad whose control we have held was acquired by Alleghany, was an operating carrier.\nAppellees also urge that the Marshall Transport case, 322 U. S. 31, requires dismissal of Alleghany's application because two stockholders, alleged to dominate Alleghany, did not join in the application, and therefore, in the absence of those two indispensable parties, the Commission had no jurisdiction to proceed.  But, in the Marshall Transport case, the Commission was refusing to approve a subsidiary's application to acquire control of the property and operating rights of another carrier unless the noncarrier parent submitted itself to the Commission's jurisdiction, and the Court upheld the Commission's power to refuse to approve the application.\nAlthough the Court in that case used language of \"jurisdiction,\" the problem is not strictly jurisdictional in the sense that, if the Commission wrongly decides that Page 353 U. S. 172 corporation or person A does not \"control\" noncarrier B (which is \"considered as a carrier\"), and therefore that A need not join B's application to acquire control of C, the Commission loses jurisdiction over B, the power to regulate B.  The Commission's jurisdiction over a noncarrier depends on whether the activities of the noncarrier fall within \u00a7 5(2) and (3), and does not depend on the action of the parent.  For example, if Alleghany were contending that it could reshuffle the whole Central system without Commission approval, alleging that the Commission had no jurisdiction over it through failure to join two stockholders controlling it in the original status order proceedings, this whole problem would appear in a clearer context.  The basis of the Commission's jurisdiction in the present case is Alleghany's status as \"a person which is not a carrier and which has control of one or more carriers,\" seeking permission \"to acquire control of another carrier through ownership of its stock or otherwise. . . .\"  The failure to join two stockholders alleged to control Alleghany does not oust the Commission of jurisdiction.  Since that is so, the status order submitting Alleghany to the Commission's jurisdiction cannot be attacked on that basis.\nAppellees further argue, and the District Court held, 134 F. Supp.  at 147-149 and 138 F. Supp.  at 136-137, that, under \u00a7\u00a7 5(2)(b) and 17(3), appellees were entitled to an evidentiary hearing of some sort in the merger status order proceeding (as distinguished from the subsequent preferred stock proceeding) even though the Commission had discretion to dispense with a \"public hearing.\"  Section 5(2)(b), in its relevant portion, provides:\n\"Whenever a transaction is proposed under subparagraph (a) . . . , the Commission shall notify the Governor of each State in which any part of the properties of the carriers involved in the proposed Page 353 U. S. 173 transaction is situated, and also such carriers and the applicant or applicants . . . and shall afford reasonable opportunity for interested parties to be heard. . . .  [A] public hearing shall be held in all cases where carriers by railroad are involved unless the Commission determines that a public hearing is not necessary in the public interest. . . .\"\n54 Stat. 906, as amended, 63 Stat. 485-486, 49 U.S.C. \u00a75(2)(b).  Section 17(3) provides, in part, that\n\"All hearings before the Commission, a division, individual Commissioner, or board shall be public upon the request of any party interested.\"\n54 Stat. 914, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 17(3).\nWe need not determine the bounds of the Commission's power to dispense with, or limit, hearings under \u00a7 5(2)(b), for appellees' claim of a right to a hearing in the merger status order proceeding must fail for another reason -- lack of the requisite interest of \"interested parties.\"\nThe reference in \u00a7 5 to \"interested parties,\" like the reference in \u00a7 1(20) to \"party in interest,\" must be interpreted in accordance with the rules relevant to standing to become parties in proceedings under the Interstate Commerce Act.  A hearing under that Act is not like a legislative hearing, and \"interest\" is not equivalent to \"concern.\"  It may not always be easy to apply in particular cases the usual formulation of the general principle governing such standing -- e.g.,\n\"the complaint must show that plaintiff has, or represents others having, a legal right or interest that will be injuriously affected by the order.\"\nMoffat Tunnel League v. United States, 289 U. S. 113,  289 U. S. 119.  In each case, the sufficiency of the \"interest\" in these situations must be determined with reference to the particular context in which the party seeks to assert its position.\nAppellees assert three grounds of interest in the merger status order proceeding:  that they were common stockholders Page 353 U. S. 174 of Alleghany, that the assertion of jurisdiction by the Interstate Commerce Commission would deprive them of the benefits of the Investment Company Act, 54 Stat. 789, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 80a-1 et seq., and that the proposed preferred stock issue was unfair.\nThe fact that appellees were common stockholders of Alleghany is insufficient \"interest.\"  The proceeding before the Commission was to determine whether the Jeffersonville-Big Four merger was a transaction requiring Commission approval as an acquisition of control by \"a person which is not a carrier and which has control of one or more carriers\" of \"another carrier through ownership of its stock or otherwise. . . .\"  54 Stat. 905, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 5(2)(a)(i).  Unlike the subsequent preferred stock order whose threatened financial injury to appellees was sufficient to confer standing to bring the present proceedings, the merger agreement had no special effect on appellees or on common stockholders of Alleghany.  See New York Central Securities Corp. v. United States, 287 U. S. 12,  287 U. S. 19-20.  Nor did the proposed status order that Alleghany should be \"considered as a carrier,\" and therefore regulated by the Interstate Commerce Commission, by itself, pose any individualized threat to the welfare of the appellees.\nReliance on the alleged benefits of protection under the Investment Company Act subtly begs the question.  Alleghany would be subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act only if the Interstate Commerce Commission lacked jurisdiction to regulate it under \u00a7 5 of the Interstate Commerce Act.  The fact that there may be another Act that gives appellees greater protection as investors is immaterial to the appellees' right to a hearing in the merger status order proceeding.  The question here is whether the proposed transaction falls within the Interstate Commerce Commission's jurisdiction, not what the consequences will be if it does not.  No special threat Page 353 U. S. 175 to appellees arises from the mere assertion of Commission jurisdiction to regulate Alleghany.  When subsequent Commission action in approving the Alleghany's new preferred stock issue did present a special threat to appellees, that provided the \"interest\" sufficient to attack the Commission's jurisdiction in the present proceeding.  But this threat could not retroactively confer upon them the right to a hearing in the merger status order proceeding, in which they had no \"interest.\"\nAppellees' claim that they were entitled to a hearing in the preferred stock proceeding is governed by \u00a7 20a(6) of the Act, which provides that \"The Commission may hold hearings, if it sees fit, to enable it to determine its decision upon the application for authority.\"  41 Stat. 495, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 20a(6).\nFor all these reasons, the judgment of the District Court must be reversed, and the case remanded for consideration by the District Court of appellees' claim, not previously discussed, that the preferred stock issue as approved by the Commission was in violation of the Interstate Commerce Act.  This disposition renders it needless to pass on appellees' motion to dismiss in No. 82.\nReversed and remanded.\nMR. JUSTICE WHITTAKER took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n* Together with No. 82, Baker, Weeks & Co. et al. v. Breswick & Co. et al., and No. 114, Interstate Commerce Commission v. Breswick & Co. et al., also on appeals from the same court.\n[Footnote 1]\nSection 5(3) provides:\n\"Whenever a person which is not a carrier is authorized, by an order entered under paragraph (2), to acquire control of any carrier or of two of more carriers, such person thereafter shall, to the extent provided by the Commission in such order, be considered as a carrier subject to such of the following provisions as are applicable to any carrier involved in such acquisition of control:  Section 20(1) to (10), inclusive of this part, sections 204(a)(1) and (2) and 220 of part II, and section 313 of part III (which relate to reports, accounts, and so forth, of carriers), and section 20a(2) to (11), inclusive, of this part, and section 214 of part II (which relate to issues of securities and assumptions of liability of carriers), including in each case the penalties applicable in the case of violations of such provisions.  In the application of such provisions of section 20a of this part and of section 214 of part II, in the case of any such person, the Commission shall authorize the issue or assumption applied for only if it finds that such issue or assumption is consistent with the proper performance of its service to the public by each carrier which is under the control of such person, that it will not impair the ability of any such carrier to perform such service, and that it is otherwise consistent with the public interest.\"\n54 Stat. 907, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 5(3).\n[Footnote 2]\n\"Notwithstanding subsections (a) and (b), of this section, none of the following persons is an investment company within the meaning of this title:  . . .\"\n\"*    *    *    *\" \n\"Any company subject to regulation under the Interstate Commerce Act, or any company whose entire outstanding capital stock is owned or controlled by such a company:  Provided, That the assets of the controlled company consist substantially of securities issued by companies which are subject to regulation under the Interstate Commerce Act.\"\n54 Stat. 789, 799, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 80a-3(c)(9).\n[Footnote 3]\nOn this appeal, the Securities and Exchange Commission, as amicus, took no position on whether the District Court\n\"correctly construed the relevant provisions of the Interstate Commerce Act or orders of the ICC thereunder; nor on the extent of the jurisdiction of the court below.\"\nThe views of the Securities and Exchange Commission were set forth only in relation to issues under the Investment Company Act.\n[Footnote 4]\nAfter the preliminary injunction was granted, Alleghany moved in the District Court for suspension of the injunction pending appeal to this Court.  The two judges who heard the motion divided, and the motion was therefore denied.  On application to Circuit Justice Harlan, a stay was granted with respect to that portion of the new preferred stock that had been issued before the District Court's injunction was granted.  Breswick & Co. v. United States, 75 S. Ct. 912.  The New York Stock Exchange, however, continued to suspend trading in the new preferred stock.\n[Footnote 5]\nSee Rochester Telephone Corp. v. United States, 307 U. S. 125,  307 U. S. 144, where the fact that the\n\"contested order determining the status of the Rochester necessarily and immediately carried direction of obedience to previously formulated mandatory orders addressed generally to all carriers . . . in conjunction with the other orders, made determination of the status of the Rochester a reviewable order of the Commission.\"\nWhether reviewability of a status order, without more, be deemed a matter of standing to review or a matter of finality of administrative action, the basis for decision is the same:  has the action of the administrative agency threatened the interests of the complainant, whether corporation or, as here, stockholder otherwise qualified to sue, sufficiently to allow attack?  (This does not mean, of course, that the same agency action that allows attack by one allows attack by the other.)\n[Footnote 6]\nA brief summary of the history of \u00a7 5 is set forth in St. Joe Paper Co. v. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co., 347 U. S. 298,  347 U. S. 315 (appendix).\n[Footnote 7]\n\"Investing the [Federal Communications] Commission with the duty to ascertaining 'control' of one company by another [as the basis for the Commission's jurisdiction], Congress did not imply artificial tests of control.  This is an issue of fact to be determined by the special circumstances of each case.  So long as there is warrant in the record for the judgment of the expert body, it must stand.  The suggestion that the refusal to regard the New York ownership of only one-third of the common stock of the Rochester as conclusive of the former's lack of control of the latter should invalidate the Commission's finding disregards actualities in such intercorporate relations.  Having found that the record permitted the Commission to draw the conclusion that it did, a court travels beyond its province to express concurrence therewith as an original question.  'The judicial function is exhausted when there is found to be a rational basis for the conclusions approved by the administrative body.'  Mississippi Valley Barge Line Co. v. United States, 292 U. S. 282,  292 U. S. 286-287; Swayne & Hoyt, Ltd. v. United States, 300 U. S. 297,  300 U. S. 303, et seq.\"\n307 U.S. at  307 U. S. 145-146.\n[Footnote 8]\n\"This phrase ['control'] has been used because it has recently had the benefit of interpretation by the Supreme Court in the case of Rochester Telephone Corp. v. United States, 307 U. S. 125, decided April 17, 1939.\"\nH.R.Rep. No. 2832, 76th Cong., 3d Sess. 63.  (This was the Conference Report.)\n[Footnote 9]\nThe United States, which had supported the orders of the Interstate Commerce Commission in the District Court proceedings, on this appeal has taken the position that the judgment of the District Court should be affirmed because the merger of the Jeffersonville into the Big Four did not involve an \"acquisition of control\" over the Jeffersonville by Alleghany.\nMR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE and MR. JUSTICE BLACK concur, dissenting.\nAlleghany Corporation, though not a carrier as that term is used in the Interstate Commerce Act, is subject to supervision by the Interstate Commerce Commission, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 5(3), and exempt from the control of the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Investment Company Act of 1940, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 80a-3(c)(9), if Page 353 U. S. 176 it has the approval of the Interstate Commerce Commission to \"acquire control of two or more carriers through ownership of their stock or otherwise.\"  49 U.S.C. \u00a7 5(2)(a)(i).\n\"Control,\" as used in \u00a7 5, is defined in \u00a7 1(3)(b):\n\". . . to include actual as well as legal control, whether maintained or exercised through or by reason of the method of or circumstances surrounding organization or operation, through or by common directors, officers, or stockholders, a voting trust or trusts, a holding or investment company or companies, or through or by any other direct or indirect means; and to include the power to exercise control.\"\n\"Control\" thus means \"actual,\" as well as \"legal,\" control, and includes the exercise of \"indirect,\" as well as \"direct,\" means.  It seems obvious, therefore -- so obvious as to be beyond the realm of dispute or argument -- that, if one has \"actual\" control through \"indirect\" means and changes the means whereby he commands that power, he has only retained \"control,\" not acquired it within the meaning of \u00a7 5(3).  For one who has \"control,\" as defined, does not acquire it when he merely changes the method or means of its exercise.  Yet it is clear that Alleghany did no more than that.\nAlleghany has control of the New York Central.\nMost of the stock of the Big Four (Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago & St. Louis R. Co.) is owned by Central.  The lines of the Big Four are operated by Central as lessee.\nThere is a Bridge Company (the Louisville & Jeffersonville Bridge & R. Co.) whose stock, prior to the transaction about to be discussed, was owned by the Big Four and held by Central under the lease.\nAlleghany, Central, the Big Four, and the Bridge Company applied to the Interstate Commerce Commission for Page 353 U. S. 177 permission to merge the Bridge Company into the Big Four and for Central thereafter to operate the properties of the Bridge Company under the Big Four lease.  The merger was an intra-system rearrangement of properties that did not affect one whit Alleghany's \"control,\" in the statutory sense, of the Bridge Company.  Before the merger, Alleghany had \"control\" of the Bridge Company.  It therefore did not \"acquire control,\" but only retained it as a result of the merger.\nThere was another transaction which Alleghany says caused it to \"acquire control\" of a carrier within the meaning of \u00a7 5(3), and therefore to have a carrier status under the Interstate Commerce Act.  Alleghany and Central applied to the Commission for permission to acquire the stock of Boston & Albany R. Co., Pittsfield & North Adams R. Corp., and Ware River R. Co.  Central was operating the properties of those three roads under leases -- two of the leases being for 99 years each and one for 999 years.  The Commission approved this stock acquisition by Central.\nThere are two reasons why this transaction did not give Alleghany a carrier status.  In the first place, \u00a7 5(3) gives a noncarrier the status of a carrier only \"to the extent provided by the Commission in such order.\"  The Commission made no such order in connection with the acquisition of the stock of the three New England carriers.\nIn the second place, Alleghany, through Central, had \"actual control\" of those three carriers prior to the acquisition of their stock.  That \"control\" was evident by the long-term leases over the properties of those carriers.  Alleghany therefore did not \"acquire control\" when Central acquired the stock of the three companies.  The form of Alleghany's control changed by the stock acquisition.  But the financial master of the three New England carriers was the same before Central acquired Page 353 U. S. 178 their stock as it was afterwards.  As stated by the District Court, where a noncarrier is \"already in indirect control of a carrier\" and the transaction relied upon \"still leaves the noncarrier in indirect control of such property, no acquisition by the noncarrier results from the merger.\"  138 F. Supp. 123, 127-128.\nThe court that made that ruling had as one of its members the late Judge Frank, who had no superior when it came to an understanding of the ways of high finance and to an analysis of regulatory measures dealing with it.  I see no answer to what Judge Frank and his colleagues concluded on this phase of the case.\nThat view of \u00a7 5(2) is plainly reflected in the legislative history.  This control over noncarriers who acquired control of carriers was introduced in 1933.  Commissioner Eastman pointed out to Congress the evil which was to be remedied\n\"holding companies have been bringing carriers under common control, and hence combining them without any supervision or approval by the commission. [Footnote 2/1]\"\nThe Senate Report stated that the amendment gave the Commission control over holding companies that \"effect consolidations without approval of the commission.\" [Footnote 2/2]  To \"acquire control\" within the meaning of \u00a7 5(2) means, then, to put under common control carriers that previously were separate.  We would strain to find a construction which would enable holding companies to run for shelter under the Act merely because, within the system they control, there have been corporate rearrangements or readjustments that change the internal structure of the system.\nAlleghany points with alarm to the loopholes in the law that will be created if it is held that Alleghany did not \"acquire\" control in connection with the Bridge Page 353 U. S. 179 Company merger and the acquisition of the stock of the New England carriers.  No loopholes will be created.  Central could do neither of those two things without the approval of the Commission, since \u00a7 5(2)(a) requires Commission approval of many intra-system transactions by carriers.  That is the force of the holding in New York Central Securities Corp. v. United States, 287 U. S. 12.  The loophole that is created comes from granting Alleghany a carrier status.  Then Alleghany escapes the far more rigorous supervision which is imposed on it by the Investment Company Act.\nThe only other means by which Alleghany could have acquired a carrier status was in connection with financial transactions long since liquidated.  Alleghany had a carrier status, granted it by the Interstate Commerce Commission, when it acquired the stock of the Chesapeake & Ohio R. Co. and two other carriers.  That order, issued in 1945, gave it a carrier status \"unless and until otherwise ordered\" by the Commission.  That order was terminated by the Commission on May 24, 1955.\nThe approval of the preferred stock issue that is involved in this litigation did not come until later, viz., June 22, 1955.  At that time, it seems plain that Alleghany had no carrier status, and could not obtain one on the basis of the intercorporate transactions on which it relies.\nI would affirm the judgment below.\n[Footnote 2/1]\nHearings, House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce on H.R. 9059, 72d Cong., 1st Sess., p. 350\n[Footnote 2/2]\nS.Rep.
